          <p class="post-description">
            <span class="bold"> Life can get complicated really quickly</span>,
            but it doesn't have to be! There are many ways to simplify your
            life,
            <span class="decorated">
              a few of which we've explored in the past</span
            >. This week we're taking a bit of a approach though, in how you can
            find simplicity in the life you already living.

                be healthy, you have to eat healthy. One of the easiest ways to
                do that is to keep your cooking nice and simple.

              <p class="post-description">
                Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated,
                it ruins their relationship with others and it leads to burnout.
                By keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help
                balance everything out.

              <p class="post-description">
                A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People
                either don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have
                the impact they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw
                the eye where you want it to and make things pop like never
                before.
